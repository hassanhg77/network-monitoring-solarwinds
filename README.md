## Overview
This script demonstrates how to use SNMP to add network devices to SolarWinds for monitoring purposes. 
This script is typically run on a management device. The management device is usually a server or a workstation that has network access to the devices you want to monitor

## Explanation
Verify SNMP Connectivity:
The verify_snmp function checks if the device is reachable via SNMP and retrieves the sysDescr OID.

Add Device to SolarWinds:
The add_device_to_solarwinds function uses the SolarWinds API to add the device.
It constructs the necessary data (node_data) and sends a POST request to the SolarWinds API endpoint.
The requests library is used to make the HTTP request, and HTTPBasicAuth is used for authentication.

Main Block:
Replace the placeholders (ip_address, community_string, solarwinds_url, username, password) with your actual values.
The script first verifies SNMP connectivity and then attempts to add the device to SolarWinds.

Important Notes
API Endpoint: Ensure the API endpoint URL is correct for your SolarWinds server.
Authentication: Use appropriate credentials with sufficient permissions to add devices.
SSL Verification: The verify=False parameter in the requests.post call disables SSL verification. For production use, consider enabling SSL verification.
